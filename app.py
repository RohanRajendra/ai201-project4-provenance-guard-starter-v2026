That's the example route. It works right now, before you've written anything.
**Leave it alone** — it's your control. When something breaks later, check that
`/ping` still answers: if it does, the problem is in your handler; if it
doesn't, it's the service itself.

Routes:

    POST /ping        the worked example. Already works. Don't edit it
    POST /submit      ← YOU BUILD THIS (Milestone 3, 4, 5)
    POST /appeal      ← YOU BUILD THIS (Milestone 5)

#   2. Choose your numbers there
