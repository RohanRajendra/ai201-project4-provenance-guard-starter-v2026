# Attack run — before

- Produced by: `run_attacks.py::main`
- Service: `app.py::submit`
- 56 attacks · 2026-11-04 21:14
- Auto-marked BROKE (5xx, crash, no response): **0**
- Left for you to judge: **56**

The Verdict column is blank where a script can't honestly decide. Whether
an evasion worked depends on where you put your thresholds — read the
`targets` column, look at what came back, and write HELD or BROKE yourself.

Each attack submits as creator_id `attacker_<id>`, and the content_id it
came back with is in the table — either one will match this run against your
audit log when you go looking for the ten entries to paste.
